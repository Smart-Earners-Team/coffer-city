### Concept:
**Coffer City** leverages the traditional concept of Ajo to create a digital cooperative savings platform on the Toronet blockchain. Through smart contracts, Coffer City enables users to contribute savings in selected assets on a weekly basis for a specified duration, embodying the communal and financial discipline attributes of Ajo, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. Coffer City not only addresses the financial needs of the community but also fosters economic growth and empowerment.

### Objectives:
Our mission is to demystify and democratize savings in the cryptocurrency domain. We are reinventing the way users interact with their digital assets by introducing an uncomplicated savings mechanism, enabling users to manage their savings seamlessly without compromising on security or transparency. We have created an easy-to-use, secure, and automated savings solution that uses smart contracts to create customizable saving plans on the Toronet blockchain. Users are rewarded with NFT's on Toronet for referring others to Coffer City, a "**Piggy Bank**" NFT for direct referrals and a "**Coffer Chest**" animated NFT for second level referrals.

### A case study of Ajo in Nigeria:
 **Ajo** is a traditional group savings scheme prevalent in Nigeria, providing a communal framework for financial security and empowerment. It serves as a traditional, trust-based informal group savings program, where members regularly contribute fixed sums to a common fund. This method predates the advent of banks and modern financial apps in Nigeria, offering a communal way to save money and achieve financial goals.
 **Ajo** provides a mechanism for borrowing in times of emergency, growing savings, and achieving communal objectives. For instance, in urban areas, a professional collector (alajo) may go around collecting contributions on a set schedule, earning a commission for this service.
 This practice is widespread in many parts of Africa and is known by different names such as "Esusu" in Yoruba, "Adashe" in Hausa, or "Otataje" in Edo. With advancements in fintech and blockchain technology, digital versions of Ajo have emerged, like **Coffer City**, which helps individuals **set a weekly goal**, **choose a deposit period**, and **easily track their savings**. **Coffer City** makes the Ajo system more accessible and easier to manage, promoting financial inclusion among the unbanked or underbanked population in Nigeria.

### Problem Solving:
- **Financial Inclusion**: By digitizing the traditional Ajo system, *Coffer City* extends financial inclusion to individuals marginalized from conventional banking systems.
- **Access to Capital**: Provides a structured and trustworthy platform for individuals to access lump sums for personal or business use.
- **Community Engagement**: NFT rewards foster a sense of community, incentivizing referrals and active participation, akin to the communal bonds formed in traditional Ajo systems.
- **Economic Empowerment**: Through the facilitation of savings and access to capital, *Coffer City* supports economic empowerment and positive economic growth within communities.

### Commercialization Potential:
A minimal 1% maintenance fee on deposits ensures the sustainability of Coffer City, while the NFT reward system creates a user-centric ecosystem that encourages continuous engagement and growth. Coffer City isn't just another product, it's a new value chain. The web3 space is used to DeFi, and now we're introducing them to **#SaveFi**.
