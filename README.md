### Introduction:
Coffer City is a web3 solution designed to tackle financial insecurities and improve economic resilience within communities in Nigeria. By leveraging blockchain technology, Coffer City provides a transparent and secure platform for individuals to engage in weekly savings/contributions towards the accumulation of selected assets over a specified duration. This initiative not only promotes financial discipline but also drives economic empowerment and financial inclusion, especially among low-income earners and informal sector operators.   

Our mission is to demystify and democratize savings in the cryptocurrency domain. We are reinventing the way users interact with their digital assets by introducing an uncomplicated savings mechanism, enabling users to manage their savings seamlessly without compromising on security or transparency. We have created an easy-to-use, secure, and automated savings solution that uses smart contracts to create customizable saving plans on the Toronet blockchain. Users are rewarded with NFT's on Toronet for referring others to Coffer City, a "**Piggy Bank**" NFT for direct referrals and a "**Coffer Chest**" animated NFT for second level referrals.

This is an original work by our team. 

### A case study of "Ajo" in Nigeria:
 **Ajo** is a traditional group savings scheme prevalent in Nigeria, providing a communal framework for financial security and empowerment. It serves as a traditional, trust-based informal group savings program, where members regularly contribute fixed sums to a common fund. This method predates the advent of banks and modern financial apps in Nigeria, offering a communal way to save money and achieve financial goals.
 **Ajo** provides a mechanism for borrowing in times of emergency, growing savings, and achieving communal objectives. For instance, in urban areas, a professional collector (alajo) may go around collecting contributions on a set schedule, earning a commission for this service.
 This practice is widespread in many parts of Africa and is known by different names such as "Esusu" in Yoruba, "Adashe" in Hausa, or "Otataje" in Edo. With advancements in fintech and blockchain technology, digital versions of Ajo have emerged, like **Coffer City**, which helps individuals **set a weekly goal**, **choose a deposit period**, and **easily track their savings**. **Coffer City** makes the Ajo system more accessible and easier to manage, promoting financial inclusion among the unbanked or underbanked population in Nigeria.

### Problem Statement:
Financial insecurity is a prevalent issue in many Nigerian communities, often exacerbated by inadequate access to formal banking and savings infrastructure. The traditional savings system known as 'Ajo' or 'Esusu' is common, but it comes with several challenges such as lack of transparency, mismanagement, and limited growth opportunities.

### Solution:
Coffer City digitizes the traditional "Ajo" model by incorporating smart contracts on the Toronet blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency in savings and asset accumulation processes. Users can choose from a variety of assets for savings, and the platform incentivizes community growth and referrals through unique NFT rewards. This modern adaptation of a trusted local savings culture could drastically improve financial habits and economic stability within communities. Through smart contracts, Coffer City enables users to contribute savings in selected assets on a weekly basis for a specified duration, embodying the communal and financial discipline attributes of Ajo, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. Thus, Coffer City not only addresses the financial needs of the community but also fosters economic growth and empowerment.

- **Financial Inclusion**: By digitizing the traditional Ajo system, *Coffer City* extends financial inclusion to individuals marginalized from conventional banking systems.
- **Innovative Funding Solution**: Coffer City offers an innovative platform for systematic savings and asset accumulation, aiding individuals in financial planning and capital accumulation for personal or entrepreneurial purposes.
- **Community Engagement**: NFT rewards foster a sense of community, incentivizing referrals and active participation, akin to the communal bonds formed in traditional Ajo systems.
- **Economic Empowerment**: Through the facilitation of savings and access to capital, *Coffer City* supports economic empowerment and positive economic growth within communities.

### Commercialization Potential:
With a minimal 1% maintenance fee, Coffer City has a built-in revenue model ensuring sustainability while keeping the platform accessible. The NFT rewards system also presents potential secondary market opportunities, further contributing to the project’s commercial viability. Coffer City isn't just another product, it's a new value chain. The web3 space is used to DeFi, and now we're introducing them to **#SaveFi**.
